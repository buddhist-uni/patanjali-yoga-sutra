  This is the source markdown file which Jekyll will compile into a complete md file for Pandoc+LaTeX.
  This frontmatter is consumed by Jekyll and won't be rendered.
  The yaml frontmatter below, starting with title:, will be output and is consumed by pandoc.
  This file is named `.html` so Jekyll won't markdownify it. The permalink field above will make sure it gets renamed to `.md` by the build.
