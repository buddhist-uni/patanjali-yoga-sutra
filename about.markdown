This project began a number of years ago, when a devoted follower of Yoga and I discussed the similarities between Patañjali's Yoga Sūtras and the Buddhist teachings.

The translation was prepared using a number of existing translations, especially the *New Translation* by Georg Feuerstein (Inner Traditions, 1979) and the *New Edition* by Edwin Bryant (North Point, 2009).

For further reading on the Buddhist roots of the Yoga Sūtra, see:
- *The Yogasūtra of Patañjali: A New Introduction to the Buddhist Roots of the Yoga System* by Pradeep P. Gokhale (Routledge, 2020)
- *Rethinking ‘Classical Yoga’ and Buddhism: Meditation, Metaphors and Materiality* by Karen O’Brien-Kop (Bloomsbury, 2022).
