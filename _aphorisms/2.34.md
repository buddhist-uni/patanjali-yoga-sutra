verse: 34
slug: "2.34"
translation: "The effort to harm, [lie, steal,] etc.—whether done [personally], caused to be done, or [simply] approved of; whether arising from greed, hatred, or delusion; whether subtle, medium, or extreme—has suffering and unending ignorance as its fruit. Therefore, the opposite should be cultivated."
